# Design Patterns

Design Patterns - GoF

1) Creation
- Abstract Factory: A contract for a factory (multiple factories). You build the object related at runtime.
- Factory Method: Define an interface to create the object, allowing the subclass to decide which instance should be created.
- Singleton: Ensure that the class has only one instance and provide a unique access point to it.
- Prototype: Allow copying of an existing object.
- Builder: Allow building an object step-by-step, in a controlled and customized manner.
